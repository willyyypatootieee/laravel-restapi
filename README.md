# Laravel REST API (Dockerized)

This project is a Laravel 12 REST API running in Docker with MySQL and phpMyAdmin. You can also use SQLite for local development.

---

## üÜï Fresh Install (SQLite Example)

If you want to use SQLite for local development, follow these steps to avoid common errors:

### On your host (for quick testing, not recommended for Docker):

```sh
php artisan key:generate
touch database/database.sqlite
php artisan migrate
# If you see an error about missing database file, create it as above and rerun migrate.
```

### Inside Docker (recommended):

```sh
docker compose exec web php artisan key:generate
docker compose exec web touch /var/www/html/database/database.sqlite
docker compose exec web php artisan migrate
```

**If you get an error like:**
> Database file at path [/var/www/html/database/database.sqlite] does not exist.

Make sure you create the file inside the container, not just on your host:
```sh
docker compose exec web touch /var/www/html/database/database.sqlite
```

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.
